        <h1>All About Me</h1>

        <h2>Bernard C. Bautista Jr.</h2>
        <p>
            I am Bernard C. Bautista Jr., a 19-year-old student originally from Zambales.
            I am currently staying in Baguio City to pursue my college education.
            Living away from home has taught me how to be more independent and responsible.
            Adjusting to a new environment has helped me grow as a person.</p>
        <p> I am studying at the University of Baguio, where I focus on developing my knowledge and skills.
            College life challenges me both academically and personally.
            It motivates me to work harder and stay committed to my goals.
            Through my studies, I aim to prepare myself for a successful future.</p>
        <p> Outside of academics, I have a strong interest in motorcycles and enjoy learning more about them.
            I find motorcycles exciting and fascinating.
            During my free time, I like playing video games to relax.
            This hobby helps me relieve stress and enjoy my downtime.</p>
